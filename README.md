# House-Prediction

# Overview

House-Prediction is a machine learning project developed as a final project in Scikit-Learn. 
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features. 
By leveraging the power of Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, we have built a predictive model that can estimate house prices with good accuracy.

# Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing information about houses. 
The dataset consists of multiple features such as the number of bedrooms, the total area, the location, and other relevant attributes. 
It also includes the actual prices of the houses, which serve as the target variable for our prediction task. 
The dataset has been carefully preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality of the data.

# Methodology

In this project, we employ various techniques and algorithms offered by Scikit-Learn to train and evaluate our predictive model. 
I follow a typical machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and data exploration. 
The project showcases how Scikit-Learn simplifies the implementation of these steps, allowing us to focus on the core aspects of machine learning.

# Model Performance

The performance of our predictive model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (RÂ²). 
I provide insights into the model's accuracy and discuss its strengths and limitations. 
Additionally, we explore potential avenues for further improvement and optimization.
